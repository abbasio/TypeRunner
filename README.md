# TYPE/RUNNER

## [Play it on itch.io!](https://abbasio.itch.io/typerunner)

TYPE/RUNNER is a 2D platforming/typing game hybrid built with JavaScript using [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/).

Quotes are pulled from the [Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable#get-random-quote), and typing along with the quotes generates platforms for the player's character to run on.


The game features four difficulty levels, each of which changes the speed at which the player must type to avoid falling.

Incorrect inputs slow the player down. Typing too slowly, or making too many typing errors, results in a game over. 

The game is completed if the player successfully types the full quote. The player is scored based on the amount of errors made and the difficulty level. High scores can be submitted to an online leaderboard, hosted with Firebase, which displays the top 10 scores in-game.

A desktop version of the game is available for download via itch, bundled with Electron. Currently only macOS version available - specifically for arm64 CPUs - but more versions will be available in the future.
