TYPE/RUNNER is a typing game built in four days with JavaScript using [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/).

Quotes are pulled from the [Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable#get-random-quote), and typing along with the quotes generates platforms for the player's character to run on.


The game features four difficulty levels, each of which changes the speed at which the player must type to avoid falling.

Incorrect inputs slow the player down. Typing too slowly, or making too many typing errors, results in a game over. 

The game is completed if the player successfully types the full quote. The player is scored based on the amount of errors made and the difficulty level.
